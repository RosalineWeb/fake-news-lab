# 🧠 Fake News Lab – Multi-Phase Portfolio Project

This is a full-stack educational project demonstrating how to build a **fake news detection system**, step by step — from design to machine learning.

Each phase highlights a different technology I’ve worked with, and together they form a complete journey from frontend to backend to AI.

## 📁 Project Structure

| Phase | Name | Technologies | Description |
|-------|------|--------------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | [phase-1-css-ui](./phase-1-css-ui) | HTML, CSS | User interface for entering a news article |
| 2️⃣ | [phase-2-php-form](./phase-2-php-form) | PHP | Backend form handling with server-side input |
| 3️⃣ | [phase-3-html-js](./phase-3-html-js) | JavaScript | Interactive UX: live character counter, form logic |
| 4️⃣ | [phase-4-ml-model](./phase-4-ml-model) | Python, Streamlit, ML | Fake news classification using a trained ML model |

## 🎯 Goal

To showcase practical, modular web development and data science skills in one unified concept:
- Clean design & UX
- Backend scripting
- Interactive JavaScript
- Machine Learning & Streamlit integration

------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 How to Run Phase 4 (ML App)

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then:

```bash
cd phase-4-ml-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py


🎯 Purpose

Fake News Lab is designed as a modular learning project that connects frontend, backend, and machine learning into one coherent concept.
The purpose of this lab is to:

    🔍 Simulate the real-world workflow of building a web-based product

    🧠 Bridge the gap between classic web development and AI-driven applications

    💡 Show practical skills through step-by-step, focused phases

    🧪 Encourage exploration through isolated, testable components

    🎯 Combine clean UX/UI with functional backend logic and AI insight

Whether it’s styling forms, handling PHP requests, adding dynamic JavaScript interactions, or deploying an ML model with Streamlit — this project ties it all together.
