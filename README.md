# 🧠 Fake News Lab – Multi-Phase Portfolio Project

This is a full-stack educational project demonstrating how to build a **fake news detection system**, step by step — from design to machine learning.

Each phase highlights a different technology I’ve worked with, and together they form a complete journey from frontend to backend to AI.

## 🎯 Goal

To showcase practical, modular web development and data science skills in one unified concept:
- Clean design & UX
- Backend scripting
- Interactive JavaScript
- Machine Learning & Streamlit integration

## 🚀 How to Run Phase 4 (ML App)

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then:

```bash
cd phase-4-ml-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

## Purpose

This repository is created as a learning lab to explore and practice front-end techniques using HTML and CSS.  
The goal is to improve my understanding of:

- Semantic HTML
- Responsive layouts (Flexbox, Grid)
- Typography and spacing
- Visual structure for media-heavy content
