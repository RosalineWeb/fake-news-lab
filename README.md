# 🧠 Fake News Lab – Multi-Phase Portfolio Project

This is a full-stack educational project demonstrating how to build a **fake news detection system**, step by step — from design to machine learning.

Each phase highlights a different technology I’ve worked with, and together they form a complete journey from frontend to backend to AI.

## 🎯 Goal

To showcase practical, modular web development and data science skills in one unified concept:
- Clean design & UX
- Backend scripting
- Interactive JavaScript
- Machine Learning & Streamlit integration

## 🚀 How to Run Phase 4 (ML App)

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then:

```bash
cd phase-4-ml-model
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

## 🎯 Purpose

This lab was created as a creative space to experiment with HTML & CSS in a flexible and stress-free way.  
It’s all about:

- 🧱 Practicing **semantic HTML** structure  
- 🎨 Exploring **responsive layouts** with Flexbox & Grid  
- 📰 Re-creating **content-heavy designs** inspired by news/media sites  
- ✍️ Playing with **typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy**  
- 🧪 Trying ideas quickly without overthinking — just building and learning

This is not a production-ready project — it’s a digital sketchbook for layout exploration and growth ✨
